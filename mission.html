      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        At Seedle, our mission is to make mental health support accessible, local, and trusted. 
        We believe no one should have to search endlessly when they need help the most. 
        That’s why we’ve built a simple way to connect people with resources that are tailored 
        to where they live and what they’re going through. Whether it’s finding a crisis line, 
        a community organization, or a support group, we want to remove barriers and bring clarity 
        to the process. Mental health challenges can feel isolating, and too often people hesitate 
        to reach out because they don’t know where to begin. Our goal is to change that by making 
        the first step easier. A single search should lead to trusted, verified resources that 
        inspire confidence. By bridging the gap between intention and action, Seedle helps people 
        take meaningful steps toward support. Every click brings someone closer to care, every 
        search is a reminder that help is available, and every connection builds a stronger, 
        more compassionate community.
