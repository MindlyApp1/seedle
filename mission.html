      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        At Seedle we aim to make <strong>student mental health support easier to reach</strong> and 
        <strong>easier to understand</strong>. Many students hesitate to seek help because the process feels 
        <strong>confusing</strong> or <strong>overwhelming</strong>. We believe every student deserves 
        <strong>clear pathways</strong> to support that are <strong>free to access</strong> and require 
        <strong>no login information</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our mission is shaped by the experiences of students who need <strong>identity affirming spaces</strong>, 
        <strong>community support groups</strong>, and environments that reflect the needs of 
        <strong>BIPOC</strong> and <strong>2SLGBTQIA+</strong> communities. We also recognize how uncertainty around 
        coverage creates hesitation, which is why we highlight when services are 
        <strong>supported through OHIP or UHIP</strong> so students feel informed before reaching out.
      </p>

      <p>
        Seedle exists to make the <strong>first step feel lighter</strong>. When information is 
        <strong>trustworthy</strong>, <strong>inclusive</strong>, and <strong>easy to navigate</strong>, students move toward 
        support with <strong>confidence</strong> rather than fear or doubt. Our goal is to ensure no one feels 
        <strong>alone in the search for help</strong> and that every student can see a path that feels 
        <strong>accessible</strong>, <strong>welcoming</strong>, and <strong>supportive</strong>.
