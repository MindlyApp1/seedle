      <h1>Our Mission</h1>
      <p>
        At Seedle, our mission is to make <strong>mental health support accessible</strong>,
        <strong>local</strong>, and <strong>trusted</strong>. We believe no one should have to
        <strong>search endlessly</strong> when they need help the most. That’s why we’ve built
        a <strong>simple way</strong> to connect people with resources that are
        <strong>tailored</strong> to where they live and what they’re going through.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether it’s finding a <strong>crisis line</strong>, a <strong>community organization</strong>,
        or a <strong>support group</strong>, we want to <strong>remove barriers</strong> and bring
        <strong>clarity</strong> to the process. Mental health challenges can feel isolating, and
        too often people hesitate to reach out because they don’t know where to begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our goal is to change that by making the <strong>first step easier</strong>. A single search
        should lead to <strong>trusted, verified resources</strong> that inspire <strong>confidence</strong>.
        By <strong>bridging the gap</strong> between <strong>intention</strong> and <strong>action</strong>,
        Seedle helps people take <strong>meaningful steps</strong> toward support. Every click brings
        someone <strong>closer to care</strong>, every search is a reminder that
        <strong>help is available</strong>, and every connection builds a
        <strong>stronger, more compassionate community</strong>.
